## Q1 — Vision Transformer on CIFAR-10 (PyTorch)
**Goal:** Implement and train a Vision Transformer (ViT) on the CIFAR-10 dataset to achieve high test accuracy.

### Current Progress
- Model setup initiated in Colab (ViT implementation ongoing)
- Baseline accuracy (expected): **60%**
- Working on: positional embeddings, CLS token, and MHSA encoder blocks

### To be updated
- Final trained weights  
- Detailed analysis (patch size, augmentation, optimizer variants)

---

## Q2 — Text-Driven Image Segmentation with SAM 2
**Goal:** Use text prompts to perform object segmentation on an image using SAM 2.

### Current Progress
- Pipeline design started in Colab
- Integrating SAM 2 and CLIPSeg modules
- Output: Text-prompted segmentation mask overlay (in progress)

---

## How to Run (Colab)
Both notebooks (`q1.ipynb` and `q2.ipynb`) will be runnable from top to bottom on **Google Colab** using GPU.  
All required installation cells will be included at the top of each notebook.

### Results Summary (Preliminary)
| Task | Model | Accuracy / Output |
|------|--------|------------------|
| CIFAR-10 Classification | Vision Transformer | ~60% (baseline, improving) |
| Text-Prompted Segmentation | SAM 2 + CLIPSeg | Work in progress |

---

**Status:** Work in progress – will update with full notebooks soon.
